# FiberAppScripts
A selection of MatLab scripts I have written to perform analysis on fiber's tracked using the FiberApp application.

You need to have FiberApp in your MatLab working path for the ImageDatatoStruct.m file to work but once that has completed all should work regardless of if you have FiberApp or not.

FiberApp can be found here... https://github.com/ivan-usov/FiberApp
